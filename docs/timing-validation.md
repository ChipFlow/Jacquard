# Timing Validation Methodology

This document describes how GEM validates timing simulation accuracy against reference simulators (CVC, Icarus Verilog). It covers test cases, comparison metrics, known simulator differences, and acceptance criteria.

## Overview

GEM's timing simulation (`--timing-vcd` and `--enable-timing` flags) must be validated against independent reference simulators to ensure correctness. We use two reference tools:

- **CVC** (Cadence Verilog Compiler): For post-layout SDF-annotated designs (commercial tool, high confidence)
- **Icarus Verilog**: For structural Verilog and Liberty-based timing (open source, good for pre-layout)

## What We Validate

### 1. Functional Correctness (Primary Validation)

**Definition**: Both GEM and reference simulators produce identical output values at each clock cycle.

**Signals compared**: Primary design outputs (e.g., `gpio_out[43:0]` for MCU SoC), NOT internal timing signals.

**Tolerance**: Exact match required. If output values differ, timing simulation has a correctness bug.

**Tool**: `compare_outputs.py` script compares VCD outputs cycle-by-cycle.

```bash
# Example: MCU SoC functional comparison
uv run tests/mcu_soc/cvc/compare_outputs.py \
    loom_output.vcd cvc_output.vcd \
    --skip-cycles 5  # Skip first 5 cycles (reset/initialization)
```

### 2. Timing Accuracy (Secondary Validation)

**Definition**: Gate-level delays and arrival times computed by GEM match reference simulator within acceptable margins.

**Known differences** (simulator-specific semantics):

| Metric | GEM | CVC | Notes |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Q arrival** | Full combo path delay (CLK→dff_in.Q + chain + interconnect) | Final gate CLK→Q only | GEM is conservative: includes downstream logic |
| **Setup slack** | Time from data arrival to DFF setup deadline | Similar | Usually aligned |
| **Hold slack** | Time from data change to DFF hold deadline | Similar | Can differ due to arrival rounding |

**Why the difference?** GEM's boomerang architecture computes cumulative delays through pipeline stages, resulting in conservative estimates that over-predict delays by including full combinational paths. CVC only reports final DFF gate delays.

**Tolerance**:
- Functional output: Exact match required
- Arrival times: ±5% acceptable (due to architectural differences)
- Setup/hold margins: ±10ps acceptable (platform-dependent rounding)

## Test Cases

### inv_chain_pnr (Simple Reference Case)

**Location**: `tests/timing_test/inv_chain_pnr/`

**Description**: Single inverted AND gate followed by a chain of inverters. Provides ground truth for:
- Basic gate delay accuracy
- Multi-stage combinational path accumulation
- Clock-to-Q propagation

**Size**: 9 cells, ~40ps full path delay

**Validation**:
```bash
# Generate CVC reference
cd tests/timing_test/inv_chain_pnr
cvc64 +typdelays tb_cvc.v inv_chain.v 2>&1 | tee cvc.log
./cvcsim 2>&1 | grep "RESULT:" # Extract: clk_to_q, chain_delay, total_delay

# Generate GEM output
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim \
    6_final.v stimulus.vcd output.vcd 1 \
    --sdf 6_final.sdf \
    --timing-vcd
```

**Expected results**:
- Loom Q arrival ≈ CVC total_delay (within ±5%)
- Both simulators show monotonic delay increase with each inverter stage

### MCU SoC post-layout (Complex Case)

**Location**: `tests/mcu_soc/data/6_final.v` + `6_final.sdf`

**Description**: Full MCU SoC design with SKY130 cells, post-P&R netlist with SDF timing.

**Size**: 2.7k cells, ~19MB netlist, ~18MB SDF

**Validation**:
```bash
# In CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml mcu-soc-metal job

# 1. Strip SDF timing checks (remove malformed TIMINGCHECK directives)
uv run tests/mcu_soc/cvc/strip_sdf_checks.py \
    tests/mcu_soc/data/6_final.sdf \
    tests/mcu_soc/data/6_final_stripped.sdf

# 2. Generate Loom timing VCD
cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim \
    tests/mcu_soc/data/6_final.v \
    tests/mcu_soc/stimulus.vcd \
    tests/mcu_soc/loom_timed_mcu.vcd 1 \
    --sdf tests/mcu_soc/data/6_final_stripped.sdf \
    --sdf-corner typ \
    --timing-vcd \
    --max-cycles 10000

# 3. Generate CVC reference
cvc64 +typdelays tests/mcu_soc/cvc/tb_cvc.v \
    tests/mcu_soc/data/6_final.v \
    tests/mcu_soc/cvc/sky130_cells.v \
    2>&1 | tee cvc_compile.log
./cvcsim > cvc_output.vcd 2>&1

# 4. Compare functional outputs
uv run tests/mcu_soc/cvc/compare_outputs.py \
    tests/mcu_soc/loom_timed_mcu.vcd \
    tests/mcu_soc/cvc/cvc_output.vcd \
    --skip-cycles 5
```

**Expected results**:
- Functional output: Exact match (or documented difference with explanation)
- Arrival times: Loom values ≥ CVC due to conservative path accumulation
- CI: Comparison completes without errors

### Pre-layout Library Timing (Future)

**Location**: TBD

**Description**: Synthesized design with Liberty timing, no SDF (gate delays from `.lib` file).

**Purpose**: Validate timing model on designs before place-and-route.

**Status**: Not yet implemented (Goal step 5)

## CI Integration

### MCU SoC Timing Comparison Workflow

The main CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) includes:

1. **mcu-soc-metal job**: Generates Loom timing VCD
   - Includes SDF stripping step (strip_sdf_checks.py)
   - Produces loom_timed_mcu.vcd with arrival time annotations

2. **mcu-soc-cvc job**: Generates CVC reference output
   - Uses stripped SDF (6_final_nocheck.sdf)
   - Produces cvc_output.vcd for comparison

3. **mcu-soc-comparison job**: Validates both produce same functional output
   - Runs compare_outputs.py
   - Reports pass/fail in CI summary
   - Skips gracefully if either simulator fails

### SDF Stripping

SDF files from post-P&R tools may contain:
- Malformed TIMINGCHECK directives (setup/hold specs with syntax errors)
- INTERCONNECT entries with escaped port names that parsers reject

**Solution**: `tests/mcu_soc/cvc/strip_sdf_checks.py` removes:
- TIMINGCHECK blocks (parser errors, not needed for gate-level functional sim)
- INTERCONNECT lines (wire delays, optional)
- Empty DELAY blocks (after INTERCONNECT removal)
- CELL blocks with escaped $ in instance names

**Result**: Stripped SDF retains ~402k lines of useful IOPATH (gate delay) data, removing ~131k problematic lines.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Boomerang Path Accumulation

**Issue**: GEM sums gate delays across all pipeline stages leading to a node, producing cumulative arrival times. CVC only reports final DFF gate delay.

**Example**: inv_chain test:
- CVC reports: CLK→Q = 350ps (final gate only)
- GEM reports: Q arrival = 1323ps (CLK→dff_in.Q + inverter chain + interconnect)

**Why**: Boomerang architecture evaluates in hierarchical stages. To know Q arrival, you sum delays from all stages.

**Mitigation**: Compare Loom Q arrival against CVC RESULT: total_delay (if available), or accept that arrival times differ but functional output matches.

### 2. SDF Parser Robustness

**Issue**: Post-P&R SDF files from various tools contain edge-case syntax that doesn't parse correctly.

**Examples**:
- Empty delay specs: `(IOPATH A B () (0:0:0))` — treated as 0ps
- COND-qualified pins: `(SETUP (COND x==1 D) (posedge CLK) (180:200:220))` — not yet supported
- Malformed TIMINGCHECK: cause parser errors in byte-range 18M+

**Current approach**: Strip SDF timing checks before use, preserving IOPATH data.

**Future**: Improve SDF parser to handle more edge cases without stripping.

### 3. Timing Model Accuracy

**Conservative model**: GEM accumulates delays pessimistically. This is intentional—designs validated under the GEM model are guaranteed to meet timing in actual P&R.

**Trade-off**: Over-predicting delays means GEM may flag timing violations that won't occur in silicon. This is preferable to under-predicting (which would give false confidence).

## Debugging Timing Failures

### When Functional Output Doesn't Match

1. **Check testbench stimulus**: Does both simulators receive same input?
   - Generate stimulus VCD: `--stimulus-vcd stimulus_out.vcd`
   - Compare against reference testbench

2. **Check SDF parsing**: Did parser successfully load all timing data?
   - Enable debug logging: `--sdf-debug`
   - Look for "unmatched SDF instances" warnings

3. **Check initialization**: Are both simulators starting from same state?
   - Compare first 5-10 cycles after reset
   - Verify reset logic is synchronized

4. **Compare against Loom non-timed version**:
   ```bash
   # Run without timing VCD
   cargo run -r --features metal --bin jacquard -- sim \
       design.v stimulus.vcd functional_output.vcd 1

   # Does functional output match CVC?
   compare_outputs.py functional_output.vcd cvc_output.vcd
   ```

### When Arrival Times Seem Wrong

1. **Verify SDF was loaded**: Check logs for "Failed to load SDF" warnings
2. **Check corner selection**: Confirm `--sdf-corner typ|min|max` matches reality
3. **Compare against CVC RESULT lines**: If available, extract CVC timing measurements
4. **Check for pipeline stage effects**: Arrival time = sum of delays across stages
